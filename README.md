# c32-angry-birds
day and night version of angry birds and check the README file for some error
in this there might be a problem while trying to acces the api as it isnt a big api
keep refreshing till you dont see an error in the console that you cant access it
if you dont see the error but the background hasnt come its because it takes some time to load so you might have to wait a few seconds
