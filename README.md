this background changing function takes some time so make sure your 
console is open
api link is open
you have called it through https:// and not http://
once that is done you might get an error trying to access the api that it can reach it
you have to keep refreshing till the error goes and once its gone the background might not come on instantly
as this api isnt that big of an api it will take some time to load as many people might be accessing it at the time
so it might take a few seconds to load but other than that you are good


(also add the images into a sprites folder as in the code we are doing "sprites/bg.img")
